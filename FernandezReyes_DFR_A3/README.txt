    3. MonoStack.h :
        /* 
        THIS IS NOT MY ORIGINAL CODE!!!! :
        Code used is from in-class for the Array Based Template Stack <ATStack.h> from module 4 
        and has had its push function and initial constructor editied to include 
        1. input for Monotonic decreasing or increasing stack conditional 
        2. (order == 'i') for increasing and ( order = d) for decreasing

    4.MonotonicStack.h
