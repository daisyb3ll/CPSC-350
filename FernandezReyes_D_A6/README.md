## 2. Project Overview (list of all source of files):
- `input.txt`
- `main.cpp`
- `WGraph.h`
- `WGraph.cpp`

### file(s) generated post compilation:
- n/a output is generated in terminal

## 3. runntime errors: 
- not to my knowledge, compilation was tested in @replit, my own device, and a friends device to be sure 
- added note; this was the project I struggled most with there are so many ways to implement kruskals wrong (or so I have learned). thank you for such a good semester! data structures was fun! - daisy
