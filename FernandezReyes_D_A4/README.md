## 5. Errors
    Compliles locally but I could not test for compiling on docker as when I tried to 
    install tkinter yesterday I changed alot of things and now im scared. I had it zipped and sent it to a friend who it compiled for so im assuming its ok! if not I am so sorry. 
    
    overgeneration of substirngs, 
        - i couldnt perfect my paltindrome finder's substring funciton in that it does now output "Substring " next to any substrings
  
## 5. instructions on running the assignment (in terminal):

    (or whatver .txt input file)
